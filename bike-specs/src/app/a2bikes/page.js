                    <h3>What are A2 bikes?</h3>
                    <p>A2 bikes are all motorcycles that can be driven with A2 license. This means they need to have 35 kw or less, and maximum power to weight ration is 0.2 kw/kg.</p>
                    <p>It is possible to put a restrictor on more powerful bikes so that their max power output doesnâ€™t cross 35 kw limit. In addition, no  motorcycle cannot output more than 70 kw out of the factory before restrictor.</p>
